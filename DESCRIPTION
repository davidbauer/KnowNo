Title: A package that reminds you to say No most of the time
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David Bauer
Maintainer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (David says No to maintaining) <nonono@davidbauer.ch>
Description: No description needed. Just make sure you have
    knowNo() in all your scripts. Because who wants to start work
    without a Disco-No-Reminder. (Damnit, now I wrote a description
    anyway. Need to become better at saying No)
